They possess significant software development experience, including relevant technologies and a focus on AI/ML, which is a strong positive. The experience with cloud infrastructure, while not explicitly detailed, is implied through working on scalable enterprise systems. The 'high-attention to details and works well in a dynamic and intense environment' is more challenging to assess from the profile alone, but the role at NICE suggests experience with demanding projects. The score is high due to the relevant skills and experience but not perfect as AWS experience needs verification.",
